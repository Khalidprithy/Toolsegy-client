        "question": "How will you improve the performance of a React Application?",
        "answer": "To improve performance we can use immutable data structures. With this we can create test and use data object in a simpler way. We can use React pure components instead of functional components. Avoid repeating code for same function. Instead of inline function we can use a separate function. Using index as key can cause performance issue. Because key should be a unique value. Props drilling can harm the performance also.",

        "question": " What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?",
        "answer": "There are many kinds of states and many ways you can manage them. Like local state we can manage using react useState hook. It will set an value locally and update when the value is changes. Global state data is managed across many components. Like we use useEffect. It runs the function and re-renders the components by default. We can use React query to handle server side states in react. ",

        "question": "How does prototypical inheritance work?",
        "answer": "The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript, With prototypical inheritance we can access properties from another object. By default, the JavaScript engine provides you with a built-in Object function and an anonymous object that can be referenced by the Object.prototype",

        "question": "Why you do not set the state directly in React?",
        "answer": "We should not update state directly because it won't update it. Updating stats directly also not good for the app performance. A state should re render when the props changes. So having a same props it won't change anything it will just re render the same value.  ",

        "question": "You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?",
        "answer": "We can fetch the data by making a api on the server. While fetching the data we can provide a search parameter and it will search the product according to that search parameter. ",

        "question": " What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?",
        "answer": "This is a process where we provide test, calls for small individual part of a application. We use unit test to identify a problem/bug/error so that we can quickly fix it. It helps us isolate a function or class when it has errors, makes it easier to find out what wrong and fic it. Overall this is a good practice as a software engineer ",
